## User Story

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

* A sample of potential employee's previous work

* The developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

* The navigation links scrolls to the corresponding section

* The developer's first application image is larger in size than the others

* Clicking on the images takes the user to that deployed application

* Resizing the page results in a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Assets

The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:
